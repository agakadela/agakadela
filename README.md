### Hi there 👋

 - Over the past eight years, I have created many website projects using **Javascript, React, WordPress**, and other modern tools like **Next.js or Redux** 👩‍💻  
 - I believe that 👉 **everyone can learn how to code** 👈, and that's why I created the online project called Coder Woman that helps women quickly start their programming journey 🦸‍♀️  
- I have worked as a web developer since I finished my sports career in volleyball 🏐  
- I learned many lessons about hard work, passion, competition, and winning as a volleyball player 🏆  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on ✨ Coder Woman ✨ project 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Machine Learning basics to gain Tensorflow certificate in the future 🤖
