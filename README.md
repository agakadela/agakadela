### Hello, world! 👋

💻 Some people talk tech. I build it.

I don’t waste time arguing about tabs vs. spaces or whether React is still “cool.” I’m too busy fixing, scaling, and pushing Next.js & React apps to perform better than ever.  
I work under **Dotty.ai**, where I build SaaS apps, Chrome extensions, AI-powered features, and automation tools — both for myself and for clients. Most of my projects are built from scratch using modern stacks, but I also take on rebuilds when no-code or AI-generated apps break under real use.

🏐 From volleyball to code—sounds weird, right? But learning to code was the hardest (and best) decision I ever made. No CS degree. No shortcuts. Just building, breaking things, and making them better.

✨ On the side, I run **Coder Woman**, for every woman who’s ever felt like she didn’t belong in tech. Trust me, I’ve been there. Now? I make sure more women break in, level up, and build careers in code.

### 🛠 Tech I Use
- **Frontend & Backend:** Next.js (App Router), TailwindCSS, TypeScript  
- **Databases:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, Firebase  
- **AI Tools:** Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, Pinecone, Hugging Face, embeddings, Assistants API  
- **Chrome Extensions:** Extension APIs, background logic, messaging  
- **Other:** REST APIs, auth, webhooks, automation logic
