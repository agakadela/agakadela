 - Over the past 9 years, while some were tangled up in the endless tech debates (seriously, tabs vs. spaces?), I've been crafting, experimenting, and perfecting web solutions with **JavaScript, React**, WordPress, and other modern tools like **Next.js and Redux** 👩‍💻  

 - Do you think coding is just a boys' club? Think again! With my Coder Woman project, I want to show that 👉 everyone can code 👈. Ladies, I've got your back if you've ever doubted tech! I'm not just challenging stereotypes; I'm tearing them down, brick by brick.

- Volleyball was my first love, teaching me about hard work and team spirit. Transitioning to tech was a big challenge. I know the doubts many women face when considering coding. Believe me, I've been there! 🏐  🏆 

- 🔭  That's why I founded  ✨ Coder Woman✨ . It's more than a project on my résumé. It's a movement. For every woman who's hesitated, wondered, or doubted—this is your tech revolution.
- I also brought to life another project - ✨ dotty.ai✨ . It's the essential news feed designed especially for women in tech.
- In the meantime, Python and Machine Learning are my playgrounds, powering up my projects with AI boost. 🤖
