 - Over the past 10 years, while some were tangled up in the endless tech debates (seriously, tabs vs. spaces?), I've been crafting, experimenting, and perfecting web solutions with **JavaScript, React**, **Redux**, **Next.js** and **WordPress** 👩‍💻  

- Volleyball was my first passion, teaching me about hard work and team spirit. Transitioning to tech was a big challenge. I know the doubts many women face when considering coding. Believe me, I've been there! 🏐  🏆 

- 🔭  That's why I founded the ✨ Coder Woman Project✨ . It's more than a project on my résumé. It's a movement. For every woman who's hesitated, wondered, or doubted—this is your tech revolution.

- Do you think coding is just a boys' club? Think again! With my Coder Woman project, I want to show that 👉 everyone can code 👈. To all the women questioning their tech potential: I'm here standing with you!
  
- Additionally, I've launched - ✨ Dotty ✨  - an AI-powered learning plan generator. Imagine a tech industry where every woman has her own roadmap to success, tailored just for her journey. That's the future Dotty is building – vibrant, inclusive, and unstoppable.
  
- In the meantime, Python and Machine Learning are my playgrounds, powering up my projects with AI boost. 🤖
