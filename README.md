Worked 1.5 years on checkout and payment systems for an e-commerce platform with 1M+ users. Thousands of transactions daily. If the code broke, they lost money immediately.

10 years total building web apps.

**What I actually do:**
- Build SaaS products (Next.js, PostgreSQL, Stripe, AI features)
- Add features to existing Next.js apps
- Fix badly written MVPs
- Stripe integrations (subscriptions, webhooks, complex billing)
- API integrations and automation

**Recent projects:**
- [FunnelScout](https://funnelscout.ai) — AI funnel analyzer that scrapes sites and identifies conversion issues (Claude API, Apify, Inngest)
- [Claro](https://claro-peach.vercel.app/) — Multi-tenant marketplace where each vendor gets isolated subdomain and Stripe payouts
- [Coder Woman](https://coderwoman.com) — Course platform with Stripe subscriptions

Stack: Next.js 14-16, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Stripe

Web apps only. No mobile.
