💻 Some people talk tech. I build it.

I don’t waste time arguing about tabs vs. spaces or whether React is still “cool.” I’m too busy fixing, scaling, and pushing Next.js & React apps to perform better than ever.

🏐 From volleyball to code—sounds weird, right? But learning to code was the hardest (and best) decision I ever made. No CS degree. No shortcuts. Just building, breaking things, and making them better.

✨ That’s why I started Coder Woman. Not just for me—for every woman who’s ever felt like she didn’t belong in tech. Trust me, I’ve been there. Now? I make sure more women break in, level up, and build careers in code.

🚀 What I actually do:  
✅ I fix messy, broken, and slow Next.js & React apps.  
✅ I scale projects so they don’t crash when they actually get traffic.  
✅ I build web apps—AI-powered and not—that are fast, scalable, and built to last.  
✅ I integrate AI-driven automation to make web apps smarter & more efficient.

🔍 Currently exploring: AI-enhanced user experiences, advanced front-end architectures, and how to make Next.js apps ridiculously fast.
🧠 Deeply diving into AI—from integrations to automation, finding smarter ways to make web applications more powerful.

👀 Check out my projects & let’s build something awesome.
